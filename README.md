## [RedLightCamData.zip](https://github.com/nthrsn/opendata/blob/main/RedLightCamData.zip)  - City of Toronto Annual Number of Red Light Camera Charges (as of Jan. 2022) 

Data is a result of geocoding a list of camera locations, orignally recorded by the city in a PDF.

Not all cameras are active (i.e. removed), and are marked by an "*" in the field name containing the location. There was also a special indicator for the year 2007 but the source data didn't specify why. If you have any information on this, or come across an incorrect camera location, [please let me know!](https://twitter.com/_nithursan)

This dataset is also hosted on ArcGIS Online as a feature layer, for anyone with a valid ESRI account to use freely. https://arcg.is/0TzqTH
